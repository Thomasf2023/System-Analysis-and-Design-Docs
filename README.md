# System-Analysis-and-Design-Docs



The DriverPass project was a project that was focused around a client named DriverPass. The client wanted to deliever a system that would allow their costumers to log onto their website, book appointments, purchase driving packages, take online test, and more. The purpose of this system was to provide a driver education service to their costumer base. One thing that I think went well over this entire project was learning how to make the differnt diagrams. I think that I was getting pretty good with the diagrams by the end of the project. That being said, I would go back and revise my diagrams and make them better after learning more information about UML design. 

The needs of the user are the most important. The reason for this is because the user is the one who will ultimately bring money into your company by using your system. They are the most important. The way that I interpreted the user's needs is by thinking like a user and designing the system with that in mind. I always thought what I would like to see if I was going to be using this system. I would use this approach when designing software to, always trying to think of the person at the end who will be using the system or product eventually. I think this is a very good way to stay grounded and design software that your costumers will want to use.
